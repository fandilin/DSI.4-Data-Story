# DSI.4-Data-Story

###The Data
I am using datasets of the 2007-2008 tests as well as datasets of cohort diploma rates and cohort postsecondary enrollment.

###Hypotheses to Investigate
1. Is there is a significant difference between diploma rates among school districts?
2. Is there a correlation between test pass rate and diploma rate for schools?
3. How well do different tests correlate with diploma rate?
4. Is there a correlation between average test score and postsecondary enrollment or achievement?
5. Have these correlations changed over time? (I would need to use datasets from multiple years.)
